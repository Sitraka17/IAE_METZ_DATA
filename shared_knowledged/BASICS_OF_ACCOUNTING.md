Creating a flashcard for the basics of accounting that a Junior Auditor must know is a great idea! Here are some key concepts and terms that are essential:

### Basic Accounting Concepts

3. **Debits and Credits**
   - **Debit**: Increases an asset or expense account, decreases a liability, revenue, or equity account.
   - **Credit**: Increases a liability, revenue, or equity account, decreases an asset or expense account.

6. **Matching Principle**
   - Expenses should be recorded in the same period as the revenues they help to generate.

8. **Journal Entries**
   - The recording of financial transactions in the accounting records.

9. **Trial Balance**
   - A list of all the accounts in the general ledger with their balances, used to ensure that debits equal credits.

11. **Closing Entries**
    - Entries made at the end of an accounting period to close temporary accounts and transfer their balances to permanent accounts.

    - The significance of an amount, transaction, or discrepancy that could influence the economic decisions of users of financial statements.

15. **Substantive Testing**
    - Audit procedures performed to detect material misstatements in the financial statements.

16. **Analytical Procedures**
    - Evaluations of financial information through analysis of plausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data.

17. **Audit Risk**
    - The risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate audit opinion when the financial statements are materially misstated.

18. **Audit Evidence**
